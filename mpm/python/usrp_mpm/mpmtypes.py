# gRPC-based MPM (rpc_version 2) listens on a different port (49602)
# than the legacy mprpc port (49601). Keeping the discovery message/port
# unchanged lets old UHD hosts (<4.10) still see the device, but their
# mprpc connection attempt on 49601 gets refused (device reported as
# "not reachable") instead of crashing from a protocol mismatch.
# The new hosts (>=4.10) will see the gRPC based device and connect to it
# on 49602, using the new gRPC protocol.
